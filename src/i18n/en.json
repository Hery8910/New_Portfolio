This path has allowed me to be creative again and tackle problems from innovative perspectives. Throughout the course, I have expanded my knowledge of building web applications, gaining a solid understanding of their technical requirements. Additionally, I was selected to be part of the DCI tutoring program, where I had the opportunity to support my classmates in their studies and projects. This experience not only allowed me to collaborate with exceptional people but also to learn from them and enhance my interpersonal skills.",
